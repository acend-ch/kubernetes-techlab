In this lab, we are going to have a look on the different deployment strategies.

This [document](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CNCF-Presentation-Template-K8s-Deployment.pdf) should give you a good start. For more details, have a look at the [examples](https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/k8s-deployment-strategies) or use [this demo](https://github.com/acend/deployment-strategies-demo) in which the different strategies are implemented as helm charts.
