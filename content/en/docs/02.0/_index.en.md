In this lab, we will install and configure the `kubectl` client to be able to practice further tasks in the labs that follow.


## Command-line interface

The `kubectl` command is the primary command-line tool to control one or several Kubernetes clusters.

As the client is written in Go, you can run the single binary on the following operating systems:

* Windows
* macOS
* Linux

{{< onlyWhen rancher >}}
{{% alert title="Tip" color="warning" %}}
In Rancher you can also use `kubectl` directly within your browser. As soon as you are logged in in the Rancher web console, click on **Launch kubectl** (or use the Â° key) and you get a console with `kubectl` installed and configured.
{{% /alert %}}
{{< /onlyWhen >}}


## Manual installation of kubectl

Follow <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/>.

In case the installation from the official package repositories didn't work (or a specific version is needed) the static binary can be downloaded and put into one of the following paths.

Linux:

```
~/bin
```

macOS:

```
~/bin
```

Windows:

```
C:\Kubernetes\
```


## File modes on Linux and macOS

The `kubectl` has to be executable:

```bash
cd ~/bin
chmod +x kubectl
```


## PATH variable

In Linux and macOS the directory `~/bin` should already be part of the `PATH` variable.
In case `kubectl` is placed in a different directory, you can change the `PATH` variable with the following command:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:[path to kubectl]
```


### Windows

The `PATH` can be set in Windows in the advanced system settings. It depends on the version:

* [Windows 7](http://geekswithblogs.net/renso/archive/2009/10/21/how-to-set-the-windows-path-in-windows-7.aspx)
* [Windows 8](http://www.itechtics.com/customize-windows-environment-variables/)
* [Windows 10](http://techmixx.de/windows-10-umgebungsvariablen-bearbeiten/)

{{% alert title="Windows quick hack" color="warning" %}}
Copy the `kubectl` binary directly into the folder `C:\Windows`.
{{% /alert %}}


## Verify installation

The `kubectl` binary should be correctly installed by now. This can be proofed by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl version
```

The output should look similar to this (version numbers and the build date can vary):

```
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"18", GitVersion:"v1.18.0", GitCommit:"9e991415386e4cf155a24b1da15becaa390438d8", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-03-25T14:58:59Z", GoVersion:"go1.13.8", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
...
```

If you don't see a similar output, possibly there are issues with the `PATH` variable.

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}}
Make sure to use at least version 1.16.x for your `kubectl`.
{{% /alert %}}


## Completion for Bash and Zsh (optional)

You can activate Bash completion:

```bash
source <(kubectl completion bash)
```

As well as for Zsh:

```bash
source <(kubectl completion zsh)
```

To make it permanent, you can put that command in your Bash configuration file:

```bash
echo "source <(kubectl completion bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
```

On most Linux systems, you have to install the `bash-completion` package to make the completion work.

Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install bash-completion
```

Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install bash-completion
```


## First steps with kubectl

The `kubectl` binary has many commands and sub-commands. Invoke `kubectl -h` to get a list of all commands; `kubectl <command> -h` gives you detailed help about a command.

If you don't want to memorize all `kubectl` options then use the `kubectl` cheat sheet: <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/>


## Optional power tools for kubectl

`kubectx` and `kubens` are two handy shell scripts which let you easily switch between Kubernetes contexts and namespaces. See <https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx> for detailed instructions.

Installation of `kubectx` and `kubens`:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmetb/kubectx/master/kubectx -o ~/bin/kubectx
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmetb/kubectx/master/kubens -o ~/bin/kubens
chmod +x ~/bin/kubectx ~/bin/kubens
```

`kube-ps1` is another helpful shell script which adds the current context and namespace to the shell prompt:
<https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1>

`fzf` is yet another handy helper tool when you have to deal with a lot of contexts or namespaces by adding an interactive menu to `kubectx`and `kubens`: <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf>

`stern` is a very powerful enhancement of `kubectl logs` and lets you tail logs of multiple containers and Pods at the same time: <https://github.com/wercker/stern>.
